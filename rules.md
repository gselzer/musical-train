# X-Team 15 Rules

These rules establish how our team will assign tasks,
track progress on each task, and communicate with each other 
when a member is unable to complete a task that has been assigned to that member.

This document helps individual members understand the team's expectations,
and will hopefully lead to productive team work with fewer conflicts
and missed deadlines.

## How we will assign (and reassign) tasks
* Divide the assignment into equal parts, use volunteering to assign a part to a person.

## How will we will track progress (and follow-up) on completion of tasks
* Use git history to record progress
* Use group chat to broadcast developments/completion.

## How will we communicate difficulties with a task assigned to us
* Use group chat to broadcast challenges/issues and to ask for suggestions to those challenges/issues.

## How we will back up each other to ensure that deadlines are not missed
* For each deadline, set a team deadline such that all individual tasks are completed **2 days** before the deadline.
* This strategy will allow sufficient time for us to integrate all of the indiviual parts and test the program as a whole.
* If someone is not meeting the deadline, we will pressure them into getting it done :smile:

## Add any other rules that your team establishes to help each other work effectively together
* If you need help, ask for it! There are (for the most part) no stupid questions.
